# Express

# Create an index.js file (or server.js) in the root of your application folder
# And then build out your Express server; in other words, import Express, import your routes
# instantiate an instance of Express, attach any necessary middleware, and so on
# and then finally start your webserver up so it can listen to requests and respond accordingly to those requests
